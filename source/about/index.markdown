<p>First and foremost, I am a family man. I am married to my best friend and have three wonderful mini Bettins. Without any question, I am the happiest when we are spending time together as a family. We live in a beautiful mountain town in Oregon named Bend. Have you heard of Bend? if not, check it <a href="http://www.visitbend.com/Discover-Bend-OR/Media-Gallery/">out</a>.</p>

<p>I love doing a lot of different things and investing in new experiences. I wish had more time to learn about other interesting things.</p> 

<p> I am currently a co-founder at an early stage financial data software company. Over the past 14 years, I have worked on my fair share of software gigs; some of them I've enjoyed, others not so much. I hope to continue to do what I enjoy.</p>
 
<p> Technically, I don't prescribe to any religion or align with any dogma; I select the technologies that help me get stuff done. I love writing code in C#, Io, Javascript and sometimes Ruby. I enjoy working on web apis, big data and solving those pesky type of problems.</p>

<p>I continuously strive to find the simplicity in everything, however, I usually fail in doing so.</p>
